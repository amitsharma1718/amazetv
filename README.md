Splash Screen: Added a SplashScreen widget that displays the app logo ("AmazeTV") and transitions to the MainScreen after 3 seconds.
MainScreen: The main screen is where the BottomNavigationBar is located to navigate between Home and Search.
HomeScreen, SearchScreen, and DetailsScreen: These screens have not changed, but the UI follows a Netflix-like design with a dark theme and red accent colors.
Now when you run the app, it will first display the splash screen, then transition to the main screen where users can explore the movies
